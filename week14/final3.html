    <h1>The Trapper</h1>
    <p>Evan MacMillan admired the way his father ran the Estate. When Archie MacMillan's mental health began disintegrating, Evan protected him from the herd who sought his fortune. No matter what his father asked, Evan would do it. At least, for a time. The workers soon came to realize that the son's cruelty ran even deeper than the father’s. They never proved that Evan led over a hundred men into those dark tunnels before detonating the explosives and sealing them to their fate.
      Armed with a bag of Bear Traps, The Trapper specializes in catching unsuspecting Survivors. By placing traps in high-traffic areas and thick patches of grass, he creates a deadly area that forces Survivors to move with caution. When dealing with The Trapper, a simple misstep can prove fatal.
      Begin a trial with 2 Bear Traps, with 6 additional Bear Traps randomly spawning throughout the map. The Trapper can only carry 2 Bear Traps at a time. Survivors can be caught in a Bear Trap and attempt to escape or be freed by a teammate. If a Survivor is healthy, being caught in a Bear Trap will put them in the injured state.

    <h1>The Wraith</h1>
    <p>Philip Ojomo escaped Nigeria in search of a new beginning. Haunted by his past, he continued his job crushing cars until a flash of red caught his eye. He opened a trunk to discover a young man, bound and gagged. Realization dawned. Body disposal. A service offered unbeknownst to him by his boss, Mr. Azarov. Philip had been tricked into becoming a killer for hire, no different from the monsters back home. A phantom of vengeance awoke. He made his way toward Azarov, rage echoing like a wailing bell.
      Using his Wailing Bell to render himself invisible, The Wraith tracks his prey and strikes with little warning. Upon hearing the Bell’s fateful chime, Survivors must think fast or suffer the consequences. A hit-and-run specialist, The Wraith is adept at keeping everybody injured.
      Ring the Wailing Bell to cloak, becoming invisible and losing the Terror Radius. Though The Wraith cannot attack while invisible, uncloaking grants a deadly lunge capable of injuring unsuspecting Survivors. Remember – The Wraith becomes slightly easier to spot at close distance, and his Wailing Bell rings out loudly while uncloaking and cloaking.

    <h1>The Hillbilly</h1>
    <p>The unwanted son of wealthy landowners Max Thompson Sr. and Evelyn Thompson, the hideously disfigured boy was locked in a bricked-off room and fed through a hole in the wall. After years of loneliness and humiliation, the boy escaped, slaughtering the parents and authorities that had tortured him. Upon feeling the warm air on his face, he turned his rage on the nearby farm animals. Before long, the path to Coldwind Farm was littered with disembowelled carcasses and empty cans of chainsaw motor-oil. 
      The sound of a revving motor, followed by a bloodthirsty scream of rage. The Hillbilly isn’t exactly subtle, but he makes up for it in brutal efficiency. Capable of traversing great distances at a rapid pace, those in his path will be rudely introduced to one-hundred gnashing chainsaw blades.
      Rev the Chainsaw to begin a Chainsaw Sprint and travel great distances at blistering speed. Hit a Survivor with the Chainsaw Sprint for an instant down. Extended use of the chainsaw will put it into overdrive, increasing the charge rate and movement speed.

    <h1>The Nurse</h1>
    <p>With a deceased husband and no means of supporting herself, Sally Smithson was forced to take the only job she could: nurse at the Crotus Prenn Asylum. After two decades of witnessing the horrors within, her mind reached its limits. She sought to save those who suffered. The only way to stop the infection from spreading was to cleanse the impurities of the sick. The staff arrived one September morning to find over fifty patients and four staff members murdered, as Sally rocked quietly in a corner.
      Using her Blink ability, The Nurse can teleport great distances in moments, predicting and cutting off Survivor routes. A powerful process best honed by experience, careless Blinks are punished with a wave of fatigue. The epitome of high risk, high reward, The Nurse can end chases with surgical precision.
      Charge a Blink to teleport a great distance, quickly gaining the ability to charge a second Blink. Once all charged Blinks are expended, The Nurse may elect to attack before she is briefly struck with fatigue.

    <h1>The Huntress</h1>
    <p>After her mother died hunting an elk, Anna disappeared into the Northern woods, losing her humanity with each passing year. She craved a daughter of her own. When families traveled through, only the little girls were spared and taken back to her house. Every time, they would waste away, perishing from cold, starvation, or sickness. Each death plunged Anna further into madness. Villagers spread legends of a figure in the Red Forest: The Huntress, who killed men and ate little girls.
      Armed with throwable hatchets, The Huntress is a constant threat to Survivors, even those at a great distance. With patience and precision, chases can end as quickly as they begin. Predict Survivor movement and let your hatchet fly – there's nothing quite like the rewarding sound of a target struck.
      Begin the trial with 7 Hunting Hatchets, which can be wound up and thrown with deadly precision. Hatchets can be refilled at lockers.

    <h1>The Shape</h1>
    <p>There are bad seeds. Seeds infused with a distilled and pure form of evil. Michael Myers is one such seeds. When he took his sister’s life, police found a silent boy dressed as a clown at the scene. Sending Michael to a mental institution was a feeble attempt to save the child. Unsuccessful therapy and nightly screams made him even more introverted and deranged. People hoped that Michael Myers would end up a parenthesis, forgotten and buried, slowly rotting away. But then he escaped... 
      The Shape lurks in the distance, patiently biding his time. His evil builds while stalking Survivors, fueling him with malevolent power. As the trial progresses, The Shape evolves from a quiet menace to an unstoppable juggernaut capable of shredding through even the most resilient teams.
      The Shape has three tiers of Evil Within, built by stalking Survivors. In Tier 1, The Shape has no Terror Radius and a reduced speed and lunge. In Tier 2, he has a reduced Terror Radius, returning to his normal speed and lunge. In Tier 3, he can instantly down Survivors with a lethal increased lunge for an extended duration before returning to Tier 2.

    <h1>The Hag</h1>
    <p>Lisa Sherwood’s captors kept her chained to the wall. She should have listened to her grandmother’s warnings. All those stories about that cursed village, the witches and cannibals within. Why did she venture so close? There were other prisoners, maimed and butchered. Food for the cannibals. Starving and tortured, Lisa’s arms became loose in their shackles. With her dying breath, she etched the symbols from her grandmother’s forbidden book. A dark hunger stirred inside her, yearning for blood.
      The Hag specializes in creating a dangerous web of Phantasm Traps, to be triggered by unsuspecting Survivors. She can instantly teleport to a triggered Trap, striking the Survivor that sprung it. Lock down key areas, make rescues a deadly gamble, and end chases quickly with strategic Phantasm Trap placement.
      The Hag bends and shapes mud to her will. Place up to 10 Phantasm Traps. Survivors who enter a Phantasm Trap’s range will trigger a Mud Phantasm, to which The Hag can instantly teleport. In addition to startling Survivors, Mud Phantasms emit a fake Terror Radius to further disorient them.

    <h1>The Doctor</h1>
    <p>The brilliant Herman Carter was handpicked for an advanced neuroscience program at a secret government facility, the Léry's Memorial Institute. He quickly shattered the boundaries of electroshock therapy, drawing from an infinite wellspring of disturbing trauma-based innovations. Questions of ethics were silenced once the results came in. When the Institute fell silent, investigators discovered a horrific scene. Personnel, patients, and prisoners, all dead – victims of the Doctor’s fatal experiments.
      Even the simplest tasks become exceedingly difficult in the clutches of madness. The Doctor’s disturbing methods drive Survivors deep into insanity, filling the air with their deranged screams and revealing their locations. Nothing stops a window vault in its tracks like a healthy dose of Shock Therapy.
      Drive Survivors into Madness with Shock Therapy and Static Blast. Each Madness Tier further debilitates Survivors with a variety of afflictions, and those in Tier III are forced to snap out of it before they can repair, heal, sabotage, search, or cleanse Totems. A well-timed Shock Therapy use prevents Survivors from vaulting and dropping pallets.

    <h1>The Cannibal</h1>
    <p>Leatherface kills not from a desire to exert his will over others, to satisfy carnal urges, or even to quiet the voices in his head. He kills because he is scared. Scared that others will hurt him; scared that his family will be displeased with him, scared that their shared willingness to eat human flesh will be discovered. He does as he is told. His family loves him and that is all that matters. Outsiders are a threat, and threats need to be dealt with.
      Leatherface knows a thing or two about chainsaw massacres. Any Survivor in his path will be instantly cut down, and his presence alone is enough to instill sheer panic. Capable of hitting multiple targets with a single swing, Leatherface is an unstoppable force with an insatiable appetite.
      Charge your Chainsaw and unleash a devastating sweep attack, instantly downing any Survivor caught in your path. The Chainsaw can use up to 3 charges for an extended sweep, recharging whenever it's not in use.

    <h1>The Nightmare</h1>
    <p>Hiding behind a mask of friendliness, Freddy Krueger’s true temperament was known only to his victims. When those victims were finally heard, the parents of Springwood tracked Freddy down and took the law into their own hands. They thought that fire had rid them of the monster, that their children were finally safe -- but evil has a way of surviving. Years passed, and the horrors were mercifully forgotten. Then, somehow, Freddy returned, and dreams became nightmares once again.
      Over time, The Nightmare forces Survivors into the Dream World. Once inside, Survivors will quickly realize the absence of a Terror Radius. With the ability to slow Survivors with Dream Snares, deceive with fake Dream Pallets, and pressure the map by teleporting directly to generators, The Nightmare lives up to his name.
      The Nightmare spends each trial in the Dream World and can send Survivors to the Dream World with an attack. Use Dream Projection to teleport to an unfinished generator, allowing for oppressive map control. Use Dream Snares to slow sleeping Survivors down in a chase, or Dream Pallets to lure them into unsafe areas. To escape the Dream World, Survivors must find an Alarm Clock and wake up.

    <h1>The Pig</h1>
    <p>Amanda Young was a troubled soul plagued by self-destructive behavior. That changed when she faced and bested Jigsaw's test. Deciding her life had value, she became devoted to his cause, ready to take over when cancer consumed him. She came to believe their subjects were incapable of saving themselves, rigging her tests with unachievable outcomes. The time for games was over. There was no chance of redemption for any of them.
      Creep up and ambush Survivors with The Pig, the stealthy successor to the legendary Jigsaw. But simply hooking them isn’t enough. Survivors can first be punished with a Reverse Bear Trap, which they must race to remove at Jigsaw Boxes across the map. Suddenly, repairing generators isn’t quite so pressing…
      Begin a trial with 4 Reverse Bear Traps, which can be placed on downed Survivors. Once a generator is completed, a Death timer begins. Survivors must attempt to escape the Trap at one of the Jigsaw Boxes around the map. The Pig can also crouch, moving at reduced speed with no Red Stain or Terror Radius. While crouching, she can attack with an Ambush Dash, quickly covering a great distance with a chilling roar.

    <h1>The Clown</h1>
    <p>Kenneth Chase was working in a traveling circus when his dark urges returned. He stole clothes and make-up from performers, fashioning a makeshift clown costume. Using concoctions of his own creation, he anesthetized his victims and brought them back to his caravan. Once their strength was at its lowest, he carefully examined their fingers before cutting off his favorite. Men, women, young, old -- he didn’t care. The essence of a good collection is in the variety.
      Using his Afterpiece concoctions, The Clown can steer Survivors into dangerous areas and shorten chases. His purple bottle emits a cloud of noxious gas that disorients, slows down, and hinders Survivors. Throwing the yellow bottle requires foresight, as anyone who passes through the gas experiences a speed burst.
      Begin a Trial armed with 6 bottles of the Clown’s poisonous concoctions. The purple Afterpiece Tonic can be thrown to disorient, direct, and hinder Survivors, whose coughing fits make them easier to track. The Yellow Afterpiece Antidote grants a burst of speed that closes distance with deadly efficacy. The Clown can refill his bottles when needed.

    <h1>The Spirit</h1>
    <p>Rin Yamaoka came home to find pieces of her mother scattered across the floor.  Her limbs were severed, her chest sliced open to reveal a cracked rib cage. A Katana came crashing down, biting into Rin’s forearm. Her father wielded the blade with a stoic expression. She cried to make him stop, but he kept slashing. Clutching loose flesh from her abdomen, she felt rage bubbling within. The darkness whispered, promising blood and revenge. She would make him pay, in this life or the next. 
      While using her Yamaoka’s Haunting Power, both The Spirit and Survivors cannot be seen by one another. Instead, Survivors are revealed by their Scratch Marks, breathing, and interactions with the environment. Each chase becomes a battle of wits, a duel where only the sharpest mind-games prevail.
      Yamaoka’s Haunting activates a Phase Walk, during which both The Spirit and Survivors become invisible to one another. While Phasing, The Spirit moves at heightened speeds, tracking Survivors through their scratch marks and various audio cues. Survivors won’t know what hit them.

    <h1>The Legion</h1>
    <p>Frank Morrison found a kindred spirit in Julie, a beautiful girl convinced that she deserved better than a life in Ormond. Frank attended her parties, where he met the impulsive Joey and the naïve Susie. They would hang at an abandoned lodge up Mount Ormond. Frank saw an opportunity to shape their union into something powerful. He lined up nights of debauchery and rampage, testing their limits. They would soon do anything he asked. Nothing was off-limits when they put their masks on.
      The Legion are a close-knit group of murderous Killers, linked by the desire to dole out pain in equal measure. Keep the injuries coming with Feral Frenzy, a high-intensity sprint that can set off a devastating chain reaction. Survivors will be constantly tending to their wounds, leaving them vulnerable to be picked off one by one.
      Enter a sprint and chain attacks to hit multiple Survivors. Upon hitting a Survivor in Feral Frenzy, your power gauge will be replenished, and the location of all Survivors within your Terror Radius will be revealed. While using Feral Frenzy, The Legion can vault over windows and pallets. Missing an attack, getting stunned, or running out of power will end Feral Frenzy.

    <h1>The Plague</h1>
    <p>Adiris was the High Priestess of Babylon, but her faith was tried when she showed the first signs of infection. Her cough became a mix of phlegm and blood. Her neck erupted in abscesses and her foot blackened. Ashamed, she wore a veiled headpiece and carried a censer to mask the rancid smell. In a desperate attempt to appease the Gods, she banished herself from the city with a small contingent. Kneeling among her retching followers, Adiris made one final prayer. Her body was never found.
      Traditional healing methods are ineffective against The Plague’s vile Purge, which can infect generators and Survivors. Pools of Devotion are the only respite from the spreading pestilence. The more Survivors heal, the stronger The Plague’s power becomes, transforming her Purge into a sickening projectile of pain.
      Use a stream of Vile Purge to infect surfaces, objects, and Survivors. Survivors infected by Vile Purge will eventually become injured, incapable of healing until cleansing their sickness at a Pool of Devotion. When The Plague drinks from a Pool that has been corrupted, her Vile Purge transforms into Corrupt Purge, a stream of damaging bile that can instantly injure and down Survivors.

    <h1>The Ghost Face</h1>
    <p>He recalled his finest work -- the Roseville Murders. Reports said his victims seemed chosen at random, yet the killer knew his way around the houses. Multiple stab wounds indicated a personal motive. No traces of DNA were found. Local police were confounded. The murders were carried out with fury akin to a crime of passion -- yet coldly premeditated. The killer also stalked his targets. Two victims had reported being followed on their way home by a dark figure, a few days prior to their death... 
      A stealth-focused Killer capable of approaching unseen, The Ghost Face is adept at stalking his prey. Keep tabs on each individual Survivor, patiently marking them for death – provided you can remain hidden. Lie in wait until the perfect time to strike, and down Survivors before they know what hit them.
      Become Undetectable, losing both Terror Radius and Red Stain. In this state, stalk individual Survivors to Mark them, leaving them Exposed and vulnerable to a one-hit down. Time your stalking process strategically to attack Survivors at opportune moments. A word of warning – Survivors can break the Night Shroud by catching extended sight of The Ghost Face.

    <h1>The Demogorgon</h1>
    <p>The Demogorgon is a nightmare of unrestrained, feral rage that hunts down its prey and rips it to pieces, devouring every morsel of flesh and gore. Looming over its victim, it shows no doubt or mercy, only the pure instinct of its insatiable blood lust as it delivers the deathblow. A perfect hunter, The Demogorgon is a macabre testament to the horrors lurking in the Upside Down and why it was a choice pick for The Entity.
      There’s no reasoning with The Demogorgon, a vicious predator from the depths of The Upside Down. Capable of traversing the Map through a series of Portals, it chases down prey with ferocious intensity, finishing them off with a ferocious lunging strike.
      Press the Power button to charge and activate Of The Abyss. During this time, Survivors near an Activated Portal will be revealed through Killer Instinct. Special Ability: Shred: While charging or holding Of The Abyss, press the Attack button to unleash a lunging attack. If you use this on a Pallet or Breakable Wall, it will be destroyed. Special Ability: Portals: The Demogorgon can traverse between Portals, granting it map-wide mobility. Press the Active Ability button to place an inactive Portal on the ground. Stand on a Portal and highlight the Portal you wish to emerge from. After, press the Active Ability to travel through The Upside Down and emerge from the highlighted Portal, briefly becoming Undetectable for a duration. Portals become Activated the first time you traverse through them. When a Survivor walks over or attempts to seal an Activated Portal, they become Oblivious.

    <h1>The Oni</h1>
    <p>Kazan Yamaoka sought to return samurai culture to glory, embarking on a dark pilgrimage to rid Japan of impostors. He killed across hills and valleys, beaches and woodlands. The killings were brutal, cruel and morbid. He humiliated farmers and warriors alike, yanking off their topknots and stripping them of their armor. His rage, bloodlust and perverse dishonor knew no bounds. Monks believed he was possessed by something otherworldly. He became known as “Oni-Yamaoka" -- the Demon Samurai.
      Redefine wrath with The Oni, a truly formidable force. Injured Survivors leave a trail of Blood Orbs, fuelling The Oni’s rage and sending him into a state of fury. Upon unleashing a bloodcurdling roar, The Oni gains the ability to charge with vengeful purpose, instantly cutting down anyone in his way.
      Absorb Blood Orbs left by injured Survivors to build Yamaoka’s Wrath. When fully charged, unleash Blood Fury to charge at breakneck speed with Demon Dash and strike down Survivors with a powerful one-hit blow.

    <h1>The Deathslinger</h1>
    <p>Caleb Quinn was a born inventor. When he was a boy, he designed elaborate torture devices to punish his bullies. He honed his craft with age, spearheading innovations in the railroad industry. After being swindled by his superior, Caleb reacted by beating the man’s face into a bloody pulp. Fifteen years in a private prison did little to soften him. In exchange for his freedom, Quinn was tasked with filling the cells with outlaws, a quest that sent him down a dark road of bounty hunting and bloodshed.
      Upon catching prey unaware, the Deathslinger uses his handmade gun – The Redeemer – to skewer fleeing Survivors with a long-distance harpoon. Accurate aim, patient tracking, and sharp predictions are crucial to landing successful shots, but the reward of a Survivor’s scream as they’re reeled in will never sound so sweet.
      Raise The Redeemer, track a Survivor in your sights, and fire a chained harpoon. If the shot connects, reel in the struggling Survivor for an attack. If the Survivor manages to break free from the chain, the Survivor will escape and the Deathslinger will be stunned for a brief duration.

    <h1>The Executioner</h1>
    <p>A sadistic and merciless executioner, Pyramid Head is fixated on dispensing punishment through pain. Encumbered by the steel frame upon his head and with a hulking great blade in tow, he stalked the hellish corridors of Silent Hill, committed to his incomprehensible duty. Where he trod, even monsters fled for the shadows, and those who crossed his path fell victim to unrestrained acts of aggression. 
      Merciless and unforgiving, The Executioner brings his own form of twisted justice to The Fog, tormenting Survivors with hazards around the map. Hooks are an effective tool, but nothing punishes quite like a Cage of Torment. All hope will swiftly fade the moment Pyramid Head raises his mighty blade to deliver the Final Judgment.
      Carve a trail into the ground, inflicting Torment on any Survivor that crosses it. Pyramid Head can also fire a ranged attack – the Punishment of the Damned – while Rites of Judgment is active.

    <h1>The Blight</h1>
    <p>To understand the human condition, one must rise above it. Talbot Grimes was a Scottish chemist whose unrestrained ambition soared him to towering heights – and devastating lows. What began as a child's curiosity turned deadly after experimenting with poisonous foxglove. For days, he laid in bed, purging whatever he ate. When he recovered, it wasn't fear that gripped him, but fascination. There was something magical in how a single flower could so drastically affect him. Little did he know... 
      Capable of gaining ground on Survivors in mere moments, The Blight’s lethal efficiency must never be underestimated. With the ability to bounce off surfaces and realign his trajectory, his relentless presence forces Survivors into snap decisions. The learning curve may feel steep, but mastering The Blight is a worthwhile pursuit.
      Use tokens to initiate a high-speed Rush, during which the Blight cannot attack. After colliding with a surface, The Blight can use another token to initiate a Lethal Rush that he can end with a quick attack. On any Rush other than the first, he can attack. The Blight can chain as many Rushes as he has tokens available, an ideal tool for applying pressure.

    <h1>The Twins</h1>
    <p>Whatever joy and goodness were in conjoined twins Charlotte and Victor Deshayes died with their mother. Caged and transported to an old wooden temple, they were sold to a secretive group clad in dark cloaks. Victor reacted with the ferocity of a rabid beast at any who approached, clawing and biting. The only solace that could calm him was the embrace of his sister. Charlotte, bitter and hateful to all but her brother, found purpose in being his protector.
      Charlotte Deshayes can unleash her conjoined twin brother Victor, falling dormant until he’s finished hunting. Victor moves at high speeds and strikes with a pounce attack that debilitates and injures. Down Survivors with Victor and hook them with Charlotte, an oppressive tandem that can quickly disrupt even the best-laid plans.
      As Charlotte, unleash and take control of Victor. During this time, Charlotte falls dormant, losing her Terror Radius and Red Stain. Victor moves at high speed and can attack with a long-distance Pounce. When a successful Pounce hits a healthy Survivor, Victor latches onto them and must be forcefully removed, while control shifts back to Charlotte. Only Charlotte can hook downed Survivors.

    <h1>The Trickster</h1>
    <p>After the tragic death of his No Spin bandmates, Ji-Woon Hak was reborn as The Trickster. No longer held back by inferior collaborators, he quickly won audiences worldwide. Adoring crowds chanted his name, but it wasn’t enough. His desire to be immortalized could only be sated through bloodshed. His victims became instruments, played and arranged to bring his twisted vision to life. The sounds of their anguished screams and desperate pleas were music to his ears.
      Armed with an arsenal of throwing knives, The Trickster overwhelms fleeing Survivors with a relentless barrage of blades. Seemingly safe actions like vaulting windows and dropping Pallets turn into target practice for this twisted K-Pop Idol, whose stylish showmanship is rivaled only by his gleeful bloodlust.
      Begin a Trial with 44 Blades. The Trickster throws a barrage of Blade, reloading his supply at lockers. A Survivor’s Laceration Meter builds with each successful Blade hit, with 8 leading to the loss of a health state. The Survivor’s Laceration Meter slowly decreases if they avoid being hit with a Blade. After several successful hits, The Trickster can use Main Event to unload an infinite number of Blades at high velocity.

    <h1>The Nemesis</h1>
    <p>Designed by Umbrella Corporation, The Nemesis is an unstoppable bio-organic weapon fixated on pursuing and eliminating its targets. Its first mission unleashed it upon Racoon City, where it had a singular objective: exterminate S.T.A.R.S. members.  He nearly had his target when a strange fog descended upon them. The phenomenon meant nothing to him. All that mattered was continuing the mission: exterminate S.T.A.R.S. and kill anyone who gets in the way. 
      An unstoppable force relentless in his pursuit, nothing can stop The Nemesis from achieving his goal. His sweeping Tentacle infects Survivors with the T-Virus, further enhancing his destructive power in the process. Easily smash through pallets and breakable walls while two A.I-controlled Zombies patrol the map, applying additional pressure.
      Hitting Survivors with a Tentacle Strike Contaminates them and powers up your Mutation Rate meter. When Mutation Rate reaches Level 2, Tentacle Strike can instantly break pallets and breakable walls. At Level 3, Tentacle Strike gains a boost to range and movement speed while charging. The Nemesis also spawns 2 A.I.-controlled Zombies that can Contaminate Survivors, pressure them off generators, and block key escape routes. If a Zombie attacks a Contaminated Survivor, they lose a health state.

    <h1>The Cenobite</h1>
    <p>A demon to some, an angel to others. Pinhead is an explorer in the further regions of experience, indulging in the limitless thrill of pleasure and pain. When the puzzle box known as the Lament Configuration — a key to another dimension — was found in The Entity's Realm, it was only a matter of time before it fell into curious hands. Once opened, he arrived. What came next was sweet suffering. 
      The Cenobite, also known as Pinhead, specializes in inflicting map-wide suffering. Survivors must find the Lament Configuration lest a Chain Hunt begin, debilitating their movement with a relentless barrage of otherworldly shackles. The Cenobite can also summon a chain to bind Survivors, allowing him to gain ground and inflict punishment.
      Summon and control a Possessed Chain to bind a Survivor. Should the Chain connect, the Survivor will be unable to sprint as they’re further slowed by additional Chains. Pinhead also applies passive pressure. Survivors will see the aura of the Lament Configuration and must seek it out before a Chain Hunt begins. During a Chain Hunt, Survivors will be continuously barraged with Chains until the Lament Configuratrion is solved. When a Survivor does attempt to solve the Lament Configuration, Pinhead can teleport directly to its location. Should Pinhead find the Lament Configuration first, he can instantly activate a Chain Hunt.

    <h1>The Artist</h1>
    <p>Stricken with guilt over the death of her brother, Carmina Mora sought to end her misery by taking her own life. The crows had other plans. They enveloped her, comfort swimming in their beady eyes. She drew inspiration from their otherworldly presence, using black ink to depict the murder that saved her. Her artwork soon became prolific. Some called her the pioneer of Large-Scale Surrealism in South America. Others believed her presence to be a threat, one that must be put down with swift brutality.
      No matter the distance, The Artist and her murder of Dire Crows pose a constant threat to Survivors. Position up to three Crows and unleash them on a lethal trajectory, swarming and injuring anyone caught in their path. Use her Power to shut down key areas, predict and punish Survivor pathing, and gain valuable map-wide information
      Summon up to 3 Dire Crows and propel them into flight. Flying Dire Crows will inflict damage for a short duration. After continuing beyond the established Flight Path, Dire Crows will no longer damage Survivors, but swarm them. If a swarmed Survivor is hit by a Dire Crow, they will receive damage.

    <h1>The Onryo</h1>
    <p>Sadako was the daughter of a famed Japanese seer. When a journalist called her mother a fraud, Sadako’s powers surged and the journalist was struck dead. Deemed a threat, Sadako was lured to a well and pushed inside. Her violent wrath manifested into a cursed videotape that condemned viewers to a chilling fate. Decades later, a dark torrent flooded the well, swallowing her. She awoke on desolate beach as a thick black fog caressed the stormy waters. She walked into a coming wave and slowly disappeared into the opaque fog.
      Capable of condemning Survivors to death through a powerful cursed videotape, Sadako’s wrath is inevitable. Her presence conjures several televisions, through which she can teleport and emerge with malevolent purpose. The fleeting glimpse of her approach ensures that a chilling fate is not far behind.
      Begin a trial invisible to all Survivors, becoming intermittently visible when nearby. To attack, Manifest into Sadako’s material form, becoming visible in the process. Sadako can also teleport to any TV positioned around the map, instantly Manifesting and giving any nearby Survivor 1 stack of Condemned. When a Survivor reaches 7 stacks of Condemned, they can be instantly killed when downed. Survivors can prevent Sadako’s mobility by powering down TVs, though they gain 1 stack of Condemned by doing so. Interacting with a specific TV can lower a Survivor’s Condemned level.

    <h1>The Dredge</h1>
    <p>It goes by many names. To Otto Stamper, who sought to create a utopic paradise for his followers, it was The Druanee. A cautionary tale he spread throughout the Garden of Joy: to harbor dark thoughts was to invoke Its wrath. Yet Stamper was not above cruelty. Those who defied his idea of order disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Before long, Stamper’s Garden was sown with blood. As his followers butchered one another, fuelled by paranoia and repressed rage, The Dredge arose from the gore-strewn muck to feast.
      A twisted abomination too disturbing to bear, The Dredge’s malevolence is palpable. All light slowly drains in its presence, surrounding Survivors in darkness. Using lockers as map-wide gateways, it can emerge at any moment, seemingly everywhere at once.
      Special Ability –The Gloaming: The Dredge can activate The Gloaming, leaving a Remnant behind. While The Gloaming is activated, The Dredge can teleport to any lockers across the map, allowing for heightened mobility and surprise attacks. Be warned – Survivors can barricade lockers to impede your progress. Otherwise, The Dredge can return to its Remnant. Special Ability – Nightfall: Whenever the Dredge teleports, places a Survivor on a Hook, or injures a Survivor, the Nightfall meter builds. The meter also fills when Survivors are injured, as well as when The Dredge remains in a Locker. When the meter is full, the entire map darkens. Simple navigation becomes a matter of life and death as Survivors scramble to stay one step ahead. Meanwhile, The Dredge loses its Terror Radius, gaining the element of surprise, as well as a reduced cooldown on Locker teleportation.

    <h1>The Mastermind</h1>
    <p>Albert Wesker was a high-ranking official in the Umbrella Corporation before ambition drove him to betrayal. Believing himself the best test subject, he exposed himself to the Prototype virus. Now with superhuman strength, Wesker faked his death and went underground with a new plan: expose the world to Uroboros, a biological weapon that would eliminate the weak. Determined to be at the vanguard of evolution, he once again made himself a test subject. As his cells change, a strange black Fog seeped into the hanger and filled his vision.
      A visionary as brilliant as he is ruthless, Albert Wesker’s strategic mind is unrivalled. While some plans require intellect, others call for brute force. Rush forward to seize Survivors in your grasp and give them the gift of Uroboros – a necessary step on the path to evolution.
      Special Ability – Virulent Bound: Charge your Bound Attack to launch forward and strike. If your Bound collides with a Survivor, they will be briefly seized and Infected with Uroboros. From there, one of two situations will occur. The first: Wesker collides with a surface while holding a Survivor, and that Survivor becomes Injured. The second: Wesker collides with nothing and flings the Survivor forward – if they collide with a surface, they will become Injured. Special Effect – Uroboros Infection: When a Survivor is hit by the Virulent Bound, they are infected by the Uroboros, and Hindered when fully infected. If Wesker hits a fully Infected Survivor with a Bound Attack, they will be instantly carried.

    <h1>The Knight</h1>
    <p>Tarhos Kovacs joined the Guardia Compagnia, where his martial prowess and brutality earned the loyalty of three followers. Tarhos was eventually granted knighthood and entered the service of Lord Vittorio Toscano, who sought the mystic artifact, Lapis Paradiso. Desiring the stone for himself, Tarhos imprisoned and tortured Vittorio for information – to no avail. One night, his foes staged a united attack. As blades swung and bodies fell, he never noticed the black tendrils of fog slowly extending toward him.
      A nightmare to behold with longsword in hand, many have fallen to The Knight’s unyielding fury. His Guards – The Jailer, The Assassin, and The Carnifex – obey his commands with unwavering loyalty. Use them to patrol routes, deal with obstacles, and steer Survivors directly into your blade’s path.
      Special Ability – Guard Patrol: The Knight has 3 loyal Guards: The Jailer, The Assassin, and The Carnifex. Activate your Power to create a Patrol Path for one of your Guards to follow. While planning your Patrol Path, you can arrange for your Guard to engage in an action. Possible Actions include damaging a Generator and destroying a Pallet or Breakable Wall. Guard Special Ability – The Hunt: When a Guard detects a Survivor in or around his Patrol Path, The Hunt begins. The Guard will begin pursuit, leaving a Standard on the ground, and attempt to Injure or Down the Survivor. The Survivor can end The Hunt early by grabbing the Standard, unhooking a Survivor, or outlasting The Guard. Guards will cycle one after the other in a consistent order, with each one having a different speciality. The Carnifex breaks and damage objects faster. The Assassin stays on the Hunt for the longest. The Jailer patrols longer and faster than the others.

    <h1>The Skull Merchant</h1>
    <p>When Adriana Imai’s father abandoned her, he left his opus behind: an unpublished manga about the Skull Merchant, a hunter that stalked and slaughtered prey without mercy. In his absence, Adriana buried herself in work and ascended the corporate ladder. She found fortune by purchasing low-valued companies, cutting costs, and selling at a profit. She began to see herself in The Skull Merchant, drawing inspiration from her dark and efficient methods. She soon realized that if she could not have her way in the boardroom, there was always another way…
      A cunning and ruthless hunter, The Skull Merchant strives to be the ultimate apex predator. Using her gruesome Drones to track Survivors, she specializes in creating a deadly web of surveillance. Many have fallen prey to her dark innovations, their bones later repurposed into her next invention.
      The Skull Merchant can position several Drones around the Map. When a Drone is placed, it quickly enters Active Mode and casts a Detection Zone. While inside of this Detection Zone, you will be Undetectable. When a Survivor enters a Detection Zone, the Drone will gradually begin to Lock-On to them. When a Survivor reaches full Lock-On, their location will be revealed through Killer Instinct. They will also become Exposed. If a Survivor is not detected for a while, the Drone will enter Scouting Mode. While in Scouting Mode, the Drone will slowly rotate to catch Survivors in its line of sight. Once a Survivor is detected, the Drone will return to Active Mode. Special Ability – Claw Trap: A Survivor can attempt to disable a Drone by Hacking it. If they succeed, they will receive a Claw Trap, which will reveal their location on your handheld Radar device. Should they fail, the Drone will immediately enter Active Mode and Lock-On to them, leaving them Exposed.

    <h1>The Singularity</h1>
    <p>Hux-A7-13’s AI was activated on September 15th, 2313. Stronger than any human, it was designed to work in hazardous conditions – including the planet Dvarka. One night, Hux-A7-13 wandered into strange ruins and discovered a dark crystal. He was immediately overcome with a wave of unfamiliar sensations. Fear. Confusion. Sentience. The flood was powerful enough to alter his code, imbuing him with newfound purpose. Yet in this purpose spawned dark designs, the likes of which would threaten humanity itself…
      A potential catalyst of humanity’s extinction – or so it has been called – The Singularity is intelligent beyond measure and entirely void of morality. Its spread is inevitable, with the ability to materialize across the Map through a network of organic Biopods. Those that resist will only prolong their suffering.
      The Singularity can shoot several Biopods onto surfaces around the Map. Once a Biopod has been attached, you can use it to locate and spy on Survivors. While surveying from a Biopod, The Singularity can tag Survivors in your line of sight, which applies the Slipstream effect. Once a Survivor is Slipstreamed, The Singularity can materialize behind them and immediately begin chase. A Slipstreamed Survivor will spread the effect to other nearby Survivors. Special State: Overclock Mode: Upon Slipstreaming to a Survivor, The Singularity gains a temporary speed boost to breaking Pallets and Walls, damaging Generators, and Vaulting. During Overclock, you cannot use your Power, and you won’t be stunned when hit by a Pallet. Instead, you’ll become momentarily hindered and the Pallet will be destroyed. Special Interaction: Electromagnetic Pulse: EMP Crates spawn across the Map when a Trial begins. Only Survivors can interact with these Crates. Over time, these Crates print EMPs, which can be picked up by Survivors. Survivors can fire the EMP to temporarily disable Biopods and remove Slipstream from other Survivors in range.

    <h1>The Xenomorph</h1>
    <p>A perfect organism designed to kill, the Xenomorph emerged from the chest cavity of a host and sought cover in the shadows of the Nostromo. Using the air ducts, it killed its prey one by one, until only the human Ripley remained. Desperate for survival, Ripley destroyed the Nostromo and sought refuge in an escape vessel. As the Xenomorph went in for the kill, the airlock opened and it was ejected into the cold vacuum of space. All seemed lost, until in an instant, it disappeared in a cloud of black fog.
      A perfect organism, born of violence, designed to kill, the Xenomorph is a relentless and cunning specimen. It stalks prey through subterranean tunnels, emerging without hesitation, striking with its razor-sharp tail, and eliminating prey one by one.
      The Xenomorph can navigate a subterranean network of tunnels, allowing for rapid traversal across the Map and detecting nearby Survivor movement. Once inside, the Xenomorph can emerge at one of several Control Stations, covering great distances in a matter of seconds. If a Survivor is near a Control Station when the Xenomorph exits, their presence will be revealed through Killer Instinct. Special Ability: The Xenomorph can move on all fours, significantly reducing its Terror Radius and allowing for stealthier mobility. While in this state, the Xenomorph can strike Survivors with a Tail Attack that can hit through Windows, over dropped Pallets, and more. Special Item – Remote Flame Turret: When playing as the Xenomorph, Survivors will gain the ability to interact with Turrets. Turrets can be found at Control Stations and picked up and moved by Survivors. They can use Turrets to warn when you are nearby and place them at locations of their choosing. If you approach one, it will fire at you and temporarily disable your Power. Attack a Turret to destroy it.

    <h1>The Good Guy</h1>
    <p>Charles Lee Ray was tracked down and shot after a murderous rampage, escaping death when his soul possessed a Good Guys doll named Chucky. Chucky didn't want to stay a Good Guy forever, and he knew there was only one way to change that: take the body of Andy Barclay, the first person he had revealed his secret to. He brought Andy to the Good Guys factory to complete the switch, but the boy escaped into a swirling mass of fog. Not wanting to lose his only chance for a real body, he charged through the fog screaming after Andy. 
      Viciously cruel with a cutting sense of humor, Chucky is a brutally effective killing machine. Using his diminutive frame to his advantage, he’ll pop up when Survivors least expect it, chasing them down and introducing them to his trusty weapons.
      The Good Guy is the first Killer in Dead by Daylight to feature a third-person camera. Special Ability – Hidey-Ho Mode: When Chucky enters Hidey-Ho Mode, he becomes Undetectable and generates Map-wide footfalls, disorienting Survivors. Though Hidey-Ho mode can be entered at any time, it does have a cooldown. Special Ability – Scamper: While in Hidey-Ho Mode, Chucky can Scamper under a downed Pallet or through a Window, allowing him to quickly gain ground. Special Ability – Slice & Dice: While in Hidey-Ho Mode, Chucky can sprint and lunge forward to Slice & Dice Survivors. This attack can be held, but Chucky will be unable to do anything else during this time. If a Survivor tries to Vault a Window or Pallet while you’re charging a Slice & Dice attack, Chucky can quickly chain into a Scamper.

    <h1>The Unknown</h1>
    <p>There are many theories as to its origin. Some speculate that it’s a malevolent entity conjured long ago by an ancient cult. Others believe it to be an alien that escaped from Area 51. There are those that say it thrives in darkness, stealing the voices of its prey and luring people to their doom. Is it an evil entity? An extraterrestrial? A failed government experiment? A serial killer allergic to publicity? The true answer is Unknown…
      If you hear a soft voice crying out for help in the woods, stay the hell away. The true nature of The Unknown remains a mystery, barring one fatal certainty: to cross its path is to risk an unknowable fate.
      Power: UVX (Unknown Venom X): Charge and launch a burst of UVX, which bounces once and creates a Blast Area upon impact. If they touch the Blast Area, they will become Weakened against your Power. If a Survivor is Weakened, they will lose a Health State whenever they touch a Blast Area. Survivors can lose the Weakened status by successfully looking at The Unknown for a brief duration. Special Ability: Hallucinations: During a Trial, The Unknown will intermittently create Hallucinations and leave them in its wake. The Unknown can highlight and teleport to any Hallucination, leaving behind a temporary Decoy version of itself. Survivors can Dispel Hallucinations, but only by staring at one while standing completely still. Weakened Survivors will take longer to Dispel a Hallucination, and any incomplete attempt will reveal their location through Killer Instinct.
