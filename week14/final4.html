    <p>The Survivor's objective is to escape the trial by repairing five of seven generators scattered throughout it to power the two exit gates.</p>

    <h1>Escaping The Trial</h1>
    <p>Find and repair five of seven generators scattered throughout the map to power the exit gates. For outside generators, look for the floodlights above them. When indoors, flickering lights will show you the way. Skill checks will appear while working on generators. Be vigilant. Failing them will set back your progress and alert the killer to your location. Once the generators have been repaired, use the switches next to the exit gates to open them and escape. If 1 survivor remains in the trial, an escape hatch will spawn somewhere in the map. It will create an ambient sound. Find it and escape before the killer closes it.</p>

    <h1>Evading The Killer</h1>
    <p>Survivors leave scratch marks when they run. Walk or crouch to avoid detection. You can also hide in lockers. When the killer is near, you'll enter their terror radius. You will hear your heartbeat pounding as they get closer. Survivors can evade the killer by vaulting through windows, stunning you with pallets, and blinding you with flashlights. The longer the chase, the more time your allies have to complete the objective. If you get downed by the killer and they don't pick you up, you can crawl away and recover so that your allies can help get you back on your feet.</p>

    <h1>The Hook</h1>
    <p>There are hooks scattered around the map. Hooks can be sabotaged by survivors with toolboxes and certain perks. Hooks will be broken if a survivor dies on them. Basement hooks are indestructable. Killers must carry survivors to these hooks to sacrifice them to the entity. While being carried to a hook, you can attempt to wiggle free of the killer's grasp. Once on a hook, survivors will have to either rely on others to rescue them or attempt to unhook themselves. Escaping from the hook by yourself is extremely slim. Survivors that get hooked twice will have to struggle against the entity to stay alive. If survivors get hooked a third time or don't get saved, they will be sacrificed.</p>

    <h1>Working Together</h1>
    <p>Escaping against the killer will take a team effort. Work on generators with others to speed up the process. Rescue hooked or dying survivors when the opportunity presents itself. Cleanse totems to disable perks. Use items found in chests. Heal those in need. Escape and live to tell the tale.</p>
