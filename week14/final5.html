    <h1>Dwight Fairfield</h1>
    <p>Dwight strove to be one of the cool kids, but never quite had the charisma. Cut by the football team. Ignored by the basketball team. Grades, distinctly below average. One weekend, on a team-building exercise from his dead-end job, his boss led them deep into the woods. Out came the family recipe moonshine. Dwight remembered taking the first sip before waking up late the next morning all alone. A laughing stock once more, Dwight began hiking his way out of the woods. He was never seen again.</p>

    <h1>Meg Thomas</h1>
    <p>Though Meg excelled at schoolwork, she was prone to flying off the rails. Perhaps it was her mother that instilled the fierce streak in her. Maybe it was her father leaving when she was a baby. Fortunately, an athletics coach encouraged her to channel her misspent energy on the track, a path that led to a college scholarship. When her mother fell ill, Meg decided to give up her athletic dreams to care for her – until one summer’s day, on a run deep in the woods, Meg simply vanished.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>Claudette Morel</h1>
    <p>Ever since Claudette got her first science kit, she loved experiments. Her passion led to an early college scholarship. Chat rooms and forums became her main source of social interaction, answering botany questions under her moniker of Science Girl. One evening, Claudette sought to be close to nature. Within minutes, the once-familiar woods twisted into something unrecognizable, shrouding her in otherworldly fog. She never found her way back. Her forum only started to wonder where she was a week after she stopped posting.</p>

    <h1>Jake Park</h1>
    <p>Growing up the son of a wealthy CEO put the weight of the world on Jake Park. Yet neither money nor ambition fulfilled him. The secrecy surrounding his grandfather’s legacy drove him on a search for answers -- much to his father’s frustration. His quest was a lonely one, and many nights he found himself haunted by questions of identity. Before long, Jake Park was lost to the world, living off the land as a survivalist. That is, until the fog engulfed the forest.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>Nea Karlsson</h1>
    <p>Nea grew up in the small town of Hjo in Sweden, veering away from expected normalcy. Her tag -- Mashtyx -- quickly decorated her hometown. Nea made a sport of tagging government buildings, avoiding authorities with nimble agility. She might have gone too far when her friends dared her to tag the abandoned Crotus Prenn Asylum, but Nea was never one to back down from a challenge. She never returned. When police arrived, all they found was her unfinished tag above the door.</p>

    <h1>William "Bill" Overbeck</h1>
    <p>It took two tours in Vietnam, a handful of medals, and an honourable discharge to get William "Bill" Overbeck to stop fighting and try to live a peaceful life. After decades spent drifting aimlessly, Bill woke to find the world he knew was gone. A plague was turning normal people into mindless killing machines. He soon found other Survivors, and together they fled from the infected hordes. In the end, he sacrificed himself to ensure their safety. Bill was left for dead, his body never found.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>David King</h1>
    <p>Free from the constraints of a career and enabled by family wealth, David King spent most of his time at the pub, drinking, watching games, and getting into fights. Few knew that he was an occasional "debt collector" or that he fought in clandestine bare-knuckle fight clubs. When David King stopped showing up to the pub, his friends were not surprised. They figured he had finally picked a fight with someone stronger. In a way, they were right.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>Laurie Strode</h1>
    <p>Laurie Strode wanted a quiet life in the suburbs, hanging out with friends and family. Maybe even going on a date or two. She did her homework and was liked by her friends, teachers, and family. A typical teenager – until a simple night of babysitting changed the course of her life forever. A night filled with bloody knives and screams from afar -- with pure, unstoppable Evil. Luckily, Laurie is made of something stronger. Something that won't give up.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>Ace Visconti</h1>
    <p>With his sharp Italian looks, grey-streaked hair and silver tongue, Ace Visconti might pass for an ageing 50's movies star – but his heart has always belonged to the cards. From his roots as a poor boy in Argentina, he gambled, scammed, seduced, and smooth-talked his way to a life of luxury as a high roller in the land of opportunity. Eventually, he racked up too many debts with the wrong kind of people. When they finally came to collect, Ace was nowhere to be found.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>Feng Min</h1>
    <p>Feng Min pushed her limits to prove she was the best. Sleep was less important to her than E-Sports training. She filled stadiums with adoring fans. The pressure to be the best grew stronger and stronger. She pushed herself too far, slept too little, and her performance slipped. She started to lose, spiralling into self-destruction. She wandered the streets and visited bars, waking up in places she didn't remember. Eventually, she woke up somewhere different -- in a never-ending nightmare.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>Quentin Smith</h1>
    <p>Quentin never attracted attention in a library, no matter how strange the texts he requested. He devoured all the information he could find on shared dream worlds, lucid dreaming, and the methods to control the dream space. Forcing himself to stay awake through a steady diet of pills and energy drinks, he scoured dusty tomes for myths about demons residing in dreams, trapping their victims, and feeding off terror. He worked quickly, as he knew that Freddy would soon be coming.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>Detective David Tapp</h1>
    <p>When David Tapp was assigned the Jigsaw case, it seemed like another lunatic with a flair for the over-dramatic. A stroke of insight brought him and his partner to an abandoned mannequin factory, where they discovered Jigsaw’s lair. The man managed to escape, slashing Tapp's throat. His partner pursued and fell victim to a fatal trap. Tapp failed to go by the book and it had resulted in a Detective's death. He was discharged from the force, left with a ruined throat and a guilt-driven obsession.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>Kate Denson</h1>
    <p>Kate Denson wrote songs to lift people out of dark places. The spotlight and success were nothing compared to the connections she forged with her fans. With a guitar in hand, Kate sang of love, friendship, and family, writing music and lyrics from a secluded grove in the forest. But that was then. These days, she’s haunted by a dark and disturbing melody, otherworldly in nature, burrowing deep into the recesses her mind. She wants it to stop, and yet – it's almost welcoming.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>Adam Francis</h1>
    <p>After growing up in Jamaica, Adam Francis' passion for literature landed him a teaching position in Japan. He learned the language and embraced the culture, forging genuine connections with his students. On the way to work, his train derailed, flipping upside down with a violent screech. As an unhinged door careened toward a passenger, Adam shielded the woman from harm, bracing for an impact that never came. Opening his eyes, he saw darkness, as tendrils of black fog swirled amidst the wreckage.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>Jeff Johansen</h1>
    <p>Jeff Johansen, artist and heavy metal aficionado, spent his teenage years working at a video store. A regular commissioned artwork for his gang at the abandoned lodge up Mount Ormond. Jeff painted a mural depicting "The Legion" in runny, bloody letters. He was given a fifty and a 12-pack. It was his first paid commission. Years later, a nostalgic Jeff returned to Ormond to check out the long-faded mural. Following his disappearance, reports noted footprints entering the lodge – but none coming out.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>Jane Romero</h1>
    <p>Jane Romero grew up in her actress mother’s shadow, inspired by her on-screen presence and resentful of her real-life absence. She too was drawn to the stage, honing her talents as a performer and director. Despite being inundated with auditions for stereotypical, underdeveloped roles, Jane found success with her own nationally aired talk show: The Jane Romero Show. At least, until a night drive down a slick highway sent her plunging into icy black depths – or so her grieving fans believed.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>Ashley J. Williams</h1>
    <p>During a weekend at a cabin, Ash Williams uncovered the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis and awoke something dark in the woods. Evil possessed his friends, whom he was forced to kill, and his right hand, which he sawed off. For the next thirty years, Ash fled his past, working at a department store and seducing women in dive bars. While high, he read from the Necronomicon to impress a woman. Evil found him once again, wrecking the lives of those around him and thrusting him into a battle for survival.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>Nancy Wheeler</h1>
    <p>When her closest friend Barb went missing, Nancy Wheeler did everything she could to unravel the truth and secure justice. A brilliant journalist, she chases stories and follows leads despite the inequality and chauvinism she encounters at the workplace. Pursuing a lead one evening, she fearlessly approached the Hawkins National Laboratory before suddenly losing consciousness. A moment later she awoke in a strange misty Realm with the sound of a familiar roar echoing through the air...</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>Steve Harrington</h1>
    <p>An unlikely mentor and leader, Steve Harrington found himself becoming a sort of "babysitter" for a group of Hawkins kids with a knack for messing with strange and dangerous things. One evening, he received a call for assistance from his friend Nancy Wheeler. He drove all the way to the Hawkins National Laboratory to see if she was okay, but all he found was her notebook. Before he realised what was happening, the ground opened and a swirl of black mist filled his eyes. When he woke up, he was in a strange place that seemed familiar but unfamiliar at the same time.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>Yui Kimura</h1>
    <p>Against her father’s will, Yui Kimura dove into the world of cars and motorcycles. Before long, she was maintaining and racing her own scooter, exhilarated by the rush of competition. She sought higher stakes, building her reputation on the illegal street racing circuit. Each victory inspired her fans -- who donned her signature pink Hachimaki in solidarity-- and enraged her rivals. Though many suspected foul play at Yui’s final race, others swore that she was swallowed by an ominous fog, never to be seen again.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>Zarina Kassir</h1>
    <p>Zarina Kassir sought to fight injustice by shining a light on untold stories. She honed her craft as a documentary filmmaker, uncompromising in her vision. Her life was uprooted when her father was callously murdered in the street. The pursuit of answers led her to the Hellshire Penitentiary, where the man responsible was being held. She spoke with prisoners and learned of a bloody massacre that left the old warden and his guards slaughtered. Intrigued, she snuck into the sealed-off ward, never to return.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>Cheryl Mason</h1>
    <p>Caring and impulsive, Cheryl Mason, previously known as Heather, attempted to rebuild her life after the tragic death of her adoptive father. While she had freed herself from the religious cult that pursued her since birth, she was shackled by the guilt of her father's death. A darkness punished her every night under the guise of abominable nightmares. To ease her conscience, she volunteered at a crisis intervention centre for troubled youth, but little could have prepared her for the first call.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>Felix Richter</h1>
    <p>Every summer, Felix Richter and his family travelled to Dyer Island, the secluded haunt of the ancient Imperati society. While exploring the island’s ruins, he came face to face with a malevolent and inexplicable phenomena. His father arrived to save his life – but Felix never saw him again. Years later, when a business opportunity led him back to Dyer Island, Felix quickly sought his old stomping grounds. He was stunned to discover his long-lost father, beckoning him deep into a swirling cloud of fog.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>Elodie Rakoto</h1>
    <p>Elodie Rakoto was forever haunted by that night at Dyer Island. While her parents handled Imperati business, she explored the ruins. She still recalled the obsidian claws tearing through the ground, the cries of her mother and father rushing to protect her. They saved her life, only to vanish entirely. Seeking answers, Élodie plunged down a rabbit hole, collecting occult artifacts in exchange for information. Her curiosity did not go unnoticed, and dark forces converged to bring her search to a violent end.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>Yun-Jin Lee</h1>

    <h1>Mikaela Reid</h1>
    <p>Adrift after her father’s death, Mikaela Reid found comfort in the dark delights of horror. Eagerly consuming tales of the macabre, she honed her storytelling abilities and began practicing witchcraft. When darkness fell, however, she was plagued by nightmares of hooks and sinister figures. One night, her roommate even witnessed her levitating above her bed. Mikaela had always suspected the existence of realms beyond the veil of reality. She would soon find how thin that veil truly was.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>Jonah Vasquez</h1>
    <p>From an early age, Jonah Vasquez’s mastery of numbers was almost supernatural. He saw vast worlds within simple structures and patterns, seeking further knowledge from history’s great mathematicians. Upon receiving a mysterious letter with an unrelated string of numbers, Jonah was plunged into a dark destiny beyond even his understanding. His search for answers led him deep into a Chilean graveyard, where he came to a haunting revelation: someone, or something, had been pulling his strings all along.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>Yoichi Asakawa</h1>
    <p>As a child, Yoichi faced the supernatural when a curse claimed his parents’ lives. As an adult, Yoichi graduated with honours in marine biology, becoming the youngest professor in the school’s history. Despite his professional success, he remained troubled.

Guided by his father’s spirit, he voyaged through treacherous waters, deep into a realm beyond rational understanding.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>Haddie Kaur</h1>
    <p>After Haddie Kaur’s parents were killed in a car crash, her mind became plagued with otherworldly visions. Visions that appeared in the darkest corners of the world, where one dimension seemed to overlap into another. She sought answers about her abilities, creating a podcast with her stepbrother Jordan and visiting the places where the overlaps were strongest. Her podcast, Ravages of the Abyss, became an instant success – that is, until Haddie's sudden disappearance during an investigation in the Alps.</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>Ada Wong</h1>
    <p>Everything about Ada Wong was an enigma. Her history, her nationality, her allegiances, her motives, even her real name. Was she a corporate spy working against the Umbrella corporation? Was she loyal to Albert Wesker or a double agent? Clearly, she was a trained assassin. A weapon’s expert with advanced martial arts training. While investigating Los Illuminados, she was captured and nearly killed in a ritual sacrifice. But in the end, she escaped and was never seen again. That, too, was an enigma.</p>

    <hr>
