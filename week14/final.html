    <h1>Plot</h1>
    <p>The Entity, an eldritch horror that exists between dimensions, is attracted to actions of great violence and malice. The majority of Killers, most of whom are serial murderers or victims of terrible tragedy, are pulled out of reality by the Entity and convinced or forced to do its bidding. In order to maintain its existence, the Entity requires sacrifices and demands that they hunt and kill the Survivors so it can feed off their emotions and steal a piece of their souls upon death. In order to continue this hunt, the Entity blocks off the gateways of death and puts the Survivors into a dreamlike state that leads them back to the Entity's purgatory-esque world to get hunted again. The Survivors are pulled into the Entity's constructed world when they wander into the woods or explore abandoned buildings, disappearing from the real world without a trace. More recent Survivors have entered through other methods such as being taken right before they die or sending themselves there using witchcraft. They end up at a campfire in the woods, where they rest between trials until a Killer pursues them again. Each trial takes place in a series of realms constructed by the Entity of areas related to each Killer's history. Escaping from the grounds always takes the Survivors back to the campfire, and offerings can be created to be burnt at it and appeal to the Entity. Since the Entity feeds off of Survivors' hopes of escaping, it helps them just as much as it helps Killers, acting as an impartial observer of the hunt and stepping in only to claim those successfully sacrificed to it.</p>

    <h1>Game Goals</h1>
    <p>One player is the Killer and the other four are Survivors. Matches are referred to as trials. The Survivor's objective is to escape the trial by repairing five of seven generators scattered throughout it to power the two exit gates. The Killer must hunt down and impale all Survivors on hooks before they escape, which will cause them to be sacrificed to a malevolent force known as the Entity.</p>

    <h1>Characters</h1>
    <p>There are over 75 playable characters. Every killer has strengths, weaknesses, and a unique power. Survivors vary only in appearance.</p>

Survivor items include medkits to heal themselves or their teammates, toolboxes to accelerate generator repairs or sabotage hooks, flashlights and firecrackers to blind the killer and save teammates from their grasp, maps to highlight objectives and resources, and keys to escape through the hatch. Every killer has a power that makes them unique. There are add-ons which can be used to customize the power to your liking. Offerings can be burnt at the beginning of the trial to influence the entity and alter how the game will be played. Offerings have specail effects on the trial, such as increasing bloodpoint rewards, changing the amount of chests in the trial, being sent to a specific map, or being able to kill survivors by your hand.
