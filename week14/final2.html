    <h1>How To Win</h1>
    <p>The Killer must hunt down and impale all Survivors on hooks before they escape, which will cause them to be sacrificed to a malevolent force known as the Entity.</p>

    <h1>Tracking Survivors</h1>
    <p>Survivors have to repair generators to escape. Patrol unrepaired generators to find your victims. You can damage these generators to impede their progress. When survivors fail skill checks or perform rushed actions, you will recieve a loud noise notification. If 1 survivor remains in the trial, an escape hatch will spawn somewhere in the map. It will create an ambient sound. Find it and close it before the survivor escapes. Once 5 generators have been repaired or the hatch is closed, the exit gates will be powered. Survivors have to open the exit gates to escape. Once they are powered, patrol exit gates to find them.</p>

    <h1>The Chase</h1>
    <p>When survivors run, they leave scratch marks that last for a short period of time. Use them to track them down. There are lockers around the map that can be used as hiding spots. You can search these lockers for anyone that tries to hide. Be wary of fixating on 1 survivor. Too much time spent on 1 person gives the others time to complete their objective and escape. Though killers move faster, survivors can evade the killer by vaulting through windows, stunning you with pallets, and blinding you with flashlights. Injured survivors can be tracked with pools of blood and loud grunts of pain.</p>

    <h1>Sacrificing Survivors</h1>
    <p>There are hooks scattered around the map. Hooks can be sabotaged by survivors with toolboxes and certain perks. Hooks will be broken if a survivor dies on them. Basement hooks are indestructable. Killers must carry survivors to these hooks to sacrifice them to the entity. Once on a hook, survivors will have to rely on others to rescue them. Survivors that get hooked twice will have to struggle against the entity to stay alive. If survivors get hooked a third time or don't get saved, they will be sacrificed.</p>
